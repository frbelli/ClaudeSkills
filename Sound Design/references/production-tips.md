# Production Tips by Mood

Practical production techniques organized by emotional mood/vibe.

---

## üåë DARK

### Sound Design Tips
- Use low-pass filters with slow cutoff sweeps (5-10 seconds)
- Add subtle dissonance with minor 2nd intervals
- Employ reverb with long decay times (3-5 seconds)
- Layer noise textures underneath (pink/brown noise)
- Keep frequencies in low-mid range (80-400 Hz focus)

### Arrangement Tips
- Sparse, spacious arrangement
- Long note durations
- Minimal melodic movement
- Heavy use of silence/negative space

### Processing Tips
- Heavy compression for claustrophobic feel
- Sidechain to create breathing effect
- Bitcrushing for grit and tension
- Saturate for warmth in darkness

## ‚òÅÔ∏è ATMOSPHERIC

### Sound Design Tips
- Use slow attack envelopes (1-2 seconds)
- Layer multiple detuned oscillators (2-4 voices)
- Apply heavy reverb and delay (wet: 60-80%)
- Slow LFO modulation for subtle movement (0.1-0.5 Hz)
- Wide stereo field with Mid-Side processing

### Arrangement Tips
- Drone-based foundation
- Evolving layers that come and go
- No harsh transients or attacks
- Gradual transitions (16-32 bars)

### Processing Tips
- Multiple delay types (ping-pong, granular)
- Subtle chorus for width
- Automation of filter cutoff over bars
- Granular synthesis for evolving textures

## üìä WORKFLOW TIPS

### Starting a Track by Mood

1. **Choose tempo** (see table above)
2. **Pick key** (see preferences)
3. **Set reverb** (see settings table)
4. **Choose scale** (from mood profile)
5. **Program first sound** (following tips)
6. **Add processing** (compression, saturation)
7. **Build arrangement** (following structure tips)

### Quick Mood Switching

To switch mood mid-track:
