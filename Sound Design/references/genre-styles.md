## 💡 GENERAL SOUND DESIGN TIPS

### BASS DESIGN
1. **Layer**: Sub (sine) + Mid (harmonics) + Top (presence)
2. **Mono**: Everything below 120Hz must be mono
3. **Sidechain**: Always to kick for space
4. **Saturation**: Add harmonics for earbuds/small speakers

### LEAD DESIGN
1. **Width**: Stereo spread for presence
2. **Movement**: LFO/automation for interest
3. **Space**: High-pass to avoid bass conflict
4. **Layering**: 2-3 layers (low, mid, high)

### PAD DESIGN
1. **Slow attack**: 500ms+ for atmosphere
2. **Long release**: 2-5s for tail
3. **Heavy reverb**: 30-60% wet
4. **Detune**: Multiple voices for thickness

### DRUM PROCESSING
1. **Transient shaping**: Emphasize attack
2. **Layering**: 2-3 samples for depth
3. **Tuning**: Drums in key with track
4. **Space**: Different reverb for depth perception
