# 🔄 Sound Design Skill - Synth Database Restructuring
## Summary of Changes (October 24, 2024)

---

## 📋 OVERVIEW

Based on user feedback regarding algorithm accuracy in the Digitone II documentation, we have restructured the synth database for improved accuracy, maintainability, and detail.

---

## ✨ WHAT CHANGED

### Before
```
references/
├── synth-database.md (all synths in one file)
│   └── Limited space for each synth
│   └── Difficult to verify accuracy
│   └── Hard to maintain
```

### After
```
references/
├── synth-database.md (quick reference index)
└── synths/
    ├── README.md (documentation standards)
    └── digitone-ii.md (complete verified reference)
        └── 8 algorithms with diagrams
        └── All parameters explained
        └── Sound design strategies
        └── Based on official manual
```

---

## 🎯 IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Accuracy ✅
**Before**: Generalized information, potential inaccuracies  
**After**: Every detail verified from official Digitone II User Manual (OS 1.00A)

**Example - Algorithms**:
- **Before**: "Algorithm #1 (Series)" - generic description
- **After**: Complete diagram of each algorithm showing operator routing, X/Y outputs, envelope routing

### 2. Detail ✅
**Before**: ~50 lines per synth (space-constrained)  
**After**: ~800+ lines for Digitone II (comprehensive)

**New Information Included**:
- Detailed algorithm diagrams (all 8)
- Operator envelope types (ADE vs ASDE)
- B1/B2 ratio "clock" behavior
- Harmonics parameter deep dive
- Filter machine comparison
- Parameter ranges and behaviors
- Sound design strategies per genre

### 3. Maintainability ✅
**Before**: Update one synth = risk breaking others  
**After**: Each synth is independent

**Benefits**:
- Update Digitone II without touching Moog Matriarch
- Easy to add new synths
- Clear version control per synth
- Traceable to source manuals

### 4. Verification ✅
**Before**: No source citations  
**After**: All info cited to manual pages

**Example**:
```markdown
**Source**: Digitone II User Manual OS 1.00A (October 2024)
**Section**: Appendix B: FM Synthesis (Pages 105-110)
```

## 🎓 DIGITONE II IMPROVEMENTS

### Algorithms (Critical Fix)

**Problem Identified**: 
User screenshot showed algorithm confusion - unclear which algorithm to use and how they work.

**Solution Provided**:
Complete documentation of all 8 algorithms with:

```
Algorithm 1: Series Chain (Maximum complexity)
    B²
     │
    B¹
     │
     A
     │
     C
    ─┴─
    X Y
```

Each algorithm now includes:
- ASCII diagram showing operator routing
- X and Y output explanation
- Envelope routing (dotted vs solid lines)
- Use cases and character description
- When to use each algorithm

### Parameters (Enhanced Detail)

**Ratio B Behavior** (Previously unclear):
```
The "clock" mechanism:
- B2 increases first (0.25 → 16.0)
- When B2 maxes, B1 increments
- B2 resets to 0.25
- Process repeats until both max

Example:
Value 0:   B1=0.25, B2=0.25
Value 64:  B1=0.25, B2=16.00 ← B2 maxed
Value 65:  B1=0.50, B2=0.25 ← B2 reset, B1 incremented
```

**HARM Parameter** (Now explained fully):
- Bipolar behavior documented
- Harmonic series progression shown
- Additive synthesis method explained
- Use cases per harmonic type

**Operator Envelopes** (Clarified):
- ADE vs ASDE modes
- Trigger vs Gate behavior
- Reset on/off diagrams
- B1/B2 level macro mapping graph
