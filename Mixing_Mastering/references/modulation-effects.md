## Modulation Fundamentals

### What is Modulation?

**Basic Concept:**
```
Definition:
- Periodic variation of a parameter
- Creates movement and animation
- Time-based effect
- Adds dimension and interest

Parameters That Can Be Modulated:
- Time/Delay (chorus, flanger)
- Phase (phaser)
- Amplitude (tremolo)
- Pitch (vibrato)
- Filter frequency
- Panning position
```

**LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator):**
```
Function:
- Generates modulation signal
- Controls effect depth and speed
- Below audio frequency (< 20 Hz)
- Creates periodic variation

Waveforms:
Sine: Smooth, musical, natural
Triangle: Similar to sine, slightly different
Square: Abrupt, rhythmic, stepped
Sawtooth: Rising or falling ramp
Random/Sample & Hold: Unpredictable, chaotic

Rate/Speed:
- How fast modulation occurs
- Measured in Hz or tempo-synced
- Slower = subtle, gentle
- Faster = obvious, intense
```

**Depth/Intensity:**
```
Controls:
- Amount of modulation applied
- Range of variation
- Subtlety vs obviousness

Settings:
Low (0-30%):
- Subtle movement
- Natural enhancement
- Transparent

Medium (30-70%):
- Obvious effect
- Musical modulation
- Standard settings

High (70-100%):
- Extreme effect
- Special effects
- Creative/obvious
```

### Wet/Dry Mix

**Balance:**
```
Dry (0% Wet):
- Original signal only
- No effect

Wet (100%):
- Effect only
- Maximum impact
- Can lose original character

Typical Settings:
Subtle: 15-30% wet
Standard: 30-50% wet
Obvious: 50-80% wet
Effect: 80-100% wet

Mixing Approach:
- Most modulation effects 20-40% wet
- More for obvious effect
- Less for enhancement
- Depends on context
